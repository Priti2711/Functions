        "Ques. 1 : What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - A RESTful API, or REST API, is a way for computer systems to exchange information over the internet. It's based on the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, which uses standard HTTP methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources. Essentially, it provides a set of rules for how clients and servers should communicate when accessing and manipulating data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques. 2 : Explain the concept of API specification.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - An API specification is a formal document that outlines how an API should function and interact with other systems. It acts as a blueprint, defining the structure, data formats, and behavior of the API. This allows developers to understand how to use the API without needing to see the underlying code or implementation details.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques. 3 : What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Flask is a lightweight micro web framework in Python, well-suited for building RESTful APIs due to its flexibility and simplicity. Its popularity stems from being easy to learn, maintain, and extend. Flask is often preferred for API development because it provides a streamlined approach to building web applications and APIs without unnecessary overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques. 4 :  What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - In Flask, routing is the mechanism that maps specific URLs to corresponding functions, known as view functions. When a user accesses a particular URL, Flask's routing system directs the request to the appropriate view function, which then generates the response.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques. 5 : How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -  1. Installation:\n",
        "\n",
        "     Make sure you have Python installed.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "     2. Create a Project Folder:\n",
        "\n",
        "      Create a new directory for your project, for example:\n",
        "\n",
        "      mkdir my_flask_app\n",
        "      cd my_flask_app\n",
        "\n",
        "     3. Create the main application file:\n",
        "\n",
        "     Inside the project directory, create a file named app.py (or any name you prefer).\n",
        "\n",
        "     Open app.py with a code editor and add the following code:\n",
        "\n",
        "     from flask import Flask\n",
        "\n",
        "     app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",

        "         app.run(debug=True)\n",
        "\n",
        "    \n",
        "    4. Run the Application:\n",
        "      \n",
        "      In your terminal, inside the project directory, run:\n",
        "\n",
        "      python app.py\n",
        "\n",
        "    5. This will start the development server. You will see an output similar to:\n",

        "     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/\n",
        "     * Debug mode: on\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques. 6 : What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In RESTful APIs, the primary HTTP methods used for interacting with resources are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These methods correspond to the CRUD operations of Create, Read, Update, and Delete. Other methods exist, but these are the most frequently employed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques. 7 : M What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The @app.route() decorator in Flask serves as a crucial mechanism for mapping specific URLs to Python functions. It essentially establishes the connection between a web request and the code that should handle it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques. 8 : What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The main difference between GET and POST in HTTP lies in how they send data to the server and their intended purpose. GET requests append data to the URL, making it visible and limited in size, and are typically used for retrieving data. POST requests send data in the request body, are not visible in the URL, and can handle larger amounts of data. POST is often used for submitting forms or creating/updating resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques. 9 : How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Error handling in Flask APIs is crucial for providing informative responses to clients when something goes wrong. Below are steps for handling the errors\n",
        "\n",
        "  1) Built-in HTTP Exceptions: Flask uses Werkzeug, which provides a set of built-in exceptions for common HTTP errors. These include: BadRequest (400): For invalid client requests, Unauthorized (401): For authentication failures, Forbidden (403): For unauthorized access, NotFound (404): When a resource isn't found, and InternalServerError (500): For server-side errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2) Raising Exceptions: You can raise these exceptions directly in your code when an error occurs:\n",
        "\n",
        "  3) Using abort(): Flask provides an abort() function to raise HTTP exceptions with a specific status code\n",
        "\n",
        "  4) Custom Error Handlers: You can use the @app.errorhandler decorator to create custom handlers for specific exceptions or status codes. This allows you to format the error response as JSON\n",
        "\n",
        "  5) Custom Exceptions: You can define your own exception classes to represent specific errors in your application. This can help make your code more readable and maintainable\n",
        "\n",
        "  6) Error Response Format: It's good practice to return error responses in a consistent format, usually JSON, with an error message and an appropriate HTTP status code.\n",
        "\n",
        "  7) Logging: Always log errors to help debug issues. You can use Flask's logging capabilities or external logging services.\n",
        "\n",
        "  8) Debug Mode: During development, Flask's debug mode can be helpful, as it provides detailed error messages in the browser. However, it should be disabled in production.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ques. 12 : What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Flask blueprints are a way to organize your Flask application into reusable and most importantly maintainable units. With blueprints, you can break your application into smaller, more manageable pieces, making it easier to maintain and scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques. 13 : What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The Flask request object is a crucial part of the framework, acting as a bridge between the client's request and the server. It encapsulates all the incoming data from a client's web page, making it accessible to the Flask application.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ques. 15 : What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Flask's jsonify() function converts Python dictionaries or lists into JSON format and automatically sets the response's Content-Type header to application/json, making it suitable for creating JSON responses in web applications. It simplifies the process of returning JSON data from Flask routes and is commonly used in API development.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques. 16 :  Explain Flask’s url_for() function.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - url_for() is a Flask function that generates a URL to a specific function dynamically. It takes the name of the view function as its first argument and any number of keyword arguments, each corresponding to a variable part of the URL rule\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques. 17 : How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Flask handles static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images by serving them directly from a designated directory within your application.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1) By default, Flask looks for a folder named static in the same directory as your main application file.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2) This folder is where you should place all your static files, such as:\n",
        "   \n",
        "   CSS files (.css)\n",
        "   JavaScript files (.js)\n",
        "   Images (.jpg, .png, .gif, etc.)\n",

        "\n",
        "  - HTTP status codes are three-digit codes that indicate the outcome of an API request. They are included in the API's response to the API client, and they include important information that helps the client know how to proceed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques. 20 : How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Define the Route:\n",
        "    1) Use the @app.route() decorator to specify the URL endpoint that will handle the POST request.\n",
        "    2) Include methods=['POST'] to indicate that this route should only accept POST requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Access Request Data:\n",
        "    1) The request object from Flask provides access to incoming request data.\n",
        "    2) For form data, use request.form to access the data as a dictionary-like object.\n",
        "    3) For JSON data, use request.json to access the data as a Python dictionary.\n",
